general ideas:
- multiple survival 'domes' with different amounts of waves (difficulty)
- randomly generated depending on biome
- dome is unbreakable until all waves are complete. (great building block as an extra reward)
- can only enter a survival dome with no items
- rewards are given when all waves are complete.
- universal book that tells you which domes you have completed so far. (and how many times, if we'll have multiple same ones)
- will be able to purchase weapons and armor while completing the waves with points that you get from killing enemies. (also could give extra points for time limit, or if player took no damage during the wave)
- all items earned from inside the dome will be removed when all waves are completed.
- different exterior blocks for each different dome type?
- hidden special blocks (sponges) that will give the player points when broken.
- quicksand in desert pyramid arena (slows and damages players).
